\section*{Summary}
Unique in the market by providing a focus on interactivity, \emph{The WebGL Companion} guides readers through an essential set of rendering techniques and 3D interaction techniques, showcasing a set of small-but-complete web apps (\emph{recipes}) at the end of each chapter.

\section*{About the Author}

Philip Rideout has worked in the field of real-time graphics for over ten years, having played roles at several pioneering graphics companies, including Intergraph, NVIDIA, and Pixar.  He is the sole author of \emph{iPhone 3D Programming} (O'Reilly Media), and a contributing author of \emph{GPU Pro 2} (A K Peters) and \emph{OpenGL Insights} (CRC Press).

\section*{Tentative Outline}

In the following outline, note that some section headings are colored in \textbf{\textcolor{Maroon}{maroon}}; these are the designated \emph{recipes}, which are tutorial-style explanations of complete example programs.

These recipes are examples of \emph{literate programming}, a term coined by Donald Knuth.  His idea was to present complete programs in a book, using ordinary English intermingled with small fragments of code.  Tools can extract the code fragments from the book's source (in this case, \LaTeX), creating complete, ready-to-build projects.
