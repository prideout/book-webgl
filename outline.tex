\section*{Summary}
\emph{The WebGL Companion} guides readers through an essential set of rendering techniques and 3D interaction techniques, showcasing a set of small-but-complete web apps (\emph{recipes}) at the end of each chapter, with diagrams and screenshots printed in full color.  This book is not only the authoritative book on WebGL, it also serves as documentation for the \emph{giza} library, developed over the course of the book.

\section*{About the Author}

Philip Rideout has worked in the field of real-time graphics for over ten years, having played roles at several pioneering graphics companies, including Intergraph, NVIDIA, and Pixar.  He is the sole author of \emph{iPhone 3D Programming} (O'Reilly Media), and a contributing author of \emph{GPU Pro 2} (A K Peters) and \emph{OpenGL Insights} (CRC Press).
