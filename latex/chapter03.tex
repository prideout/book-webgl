\chapter{Using Art Assets}
\section{Texture Coordinates}
\summary{Quick overview of texture coordinates and wrap modes.  For an example, shows how to apply a section of the Mona Lisa to a quad.}
\section{Texture Filtering}
\summary{Explanation of minification, magnification, and mipmapping; uses small pixel art to illustrate the effects of filtering.} % space invaders! % or, http://opengameart.org/content/japanese-buildings-isometric-strategy-game-mockup
\section{Procedural Art}
\summary{Shows how some assets can be generated on the fly, as opposed to downloaded.} % Generate the geometry with node.js?
\subsection{Parametric Surfaces}
\summary{Using JavaScript to generate basic shapes like spheres and donuts.} % Generate the geometry with node.js?
\subsection{Implicit Paths}
\summary{Using fragment shaders to fill the interior of a bounded 2D region.}
\subsection{Perlin Noise}
\summary{Gives a brief overview of noise and applications; covers some techniques for generating noise in GLSL.} % Javascript too?
\section{Loading Mesh Data with XMLHttpRequest}
\summary{Implements Giza's download functionality; also mentions \texttt{webgl-loader}.}
\rrecipe{Recipe 3: Planet Mars}
\summary{Downloads and renders a sphere mesh and Mars texture; also demonstrates \\\texttt{WEBGL\_compressed\_texture\_s3tc.}} % Maybe even the two moons?
