==========

Description for ALL subsections:
Title. Brief. Detailed.  Notes.
Create an "Other Libraries" section
Add a section somewhere on Security
Flesh out with some stuff from my WebGL cookbook spreadsheet
In the introduction, mention Giza Library
More math build-up
Add a section on webcam
http://dev.opera.com/static/articles/2012/webgl-postprocessing/webgl-pp/texImage2D.html
Add a tunnel section

I'm not happy with the weird color scheme and randomness of verbose vs samples
Mona's idea: How about every chapter has a sample that leverages everything from the chapter?
   The code snippets in all sections of the chapter (except the last) often (but not always) define functions in the giza library;
   The LAST section of the chapter walks through a particular demo of the giza library
