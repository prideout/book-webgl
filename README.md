# Notes

We need to add a section somewhere for lost context stuff
http://blog.xeolabs.com/handling-a-lost-webgl-context-in-scenejs
+ I think there's an extension

For chapter 11:

Possibly add webgl-texture-utils to Chapter 11
https://github.com/alteredq/webgl-texture-utils

The chapter on loading large meshes should demo a progress bar

The chapter on webcam effects:
